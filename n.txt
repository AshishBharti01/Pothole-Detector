To set up remote access to your Raspberry Pi, you have a couple of options

SSH (Secure Shell) SSH provides a secure way to access and control your Raspberry Pi remotely. Here's how you can set up SSH

Enable SSH on your Raspberry Pi by running the command sudo raspi-config in the terminal, selecting Interfacing Options, and enabling SSH.

Find the IP address of your Raspberry Pi by running the command ifconfig or hostname -I in the terminal.

On your local computer, open a terminal or command prompt and use the following command to connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH

kotlin
Copy code
ssh pi@raspberry_pi_ip_address
Replace raspberry_pi_ip_address with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi.

Enter the username (pi by default) and password for your Raspberry Pi when prompted.

You should now have a remote terminal session connected to your Raspberry Pi. You can run commands and control the Raspberry Pi remotely.

VNC (Virtual Network Computing) VNC allows you to access the graphical desktop interface of your Raspberry Pi remotely. Here's how to set up VNC

Install a VNC server on your Raspberry Pi, such as RealVNC or TigerVNC. You can typically install it using the package manager (e.g., apt).

Configure the VNC server to start automatically on boot. The specific steps may vary depending on the VNC server you choose. Refer to the documentation for the server you installed.

Find the IP address of your Raspberry Pi by running the command ifconfig or hostname -I in the terminal.

On your local computer, install a VNC client such as RealVNC Viewer, TigerVNC, or TightVNC.

Open the VNC client and enter the IP address of your Raspberry Pi to connect to it.

You should now be able to see and interact with the graphical desktop interface of your Raspberry Pi remotely.

Remember to ensure that your Raspberry Pi and your local computer are on the same network for remote access to work.
